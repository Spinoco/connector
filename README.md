# Spinoco Data Connector 

This project contains the source of the Spinoco data connector. 

Spinoco data connector is a tool that can be used to retrieve datasets from the Spinoco Platform in near real-time . 

The tool is designed to run as a service, ideally packaged in a provided docker image.

## Configuration

The tool is configured using environment variables.

### Common configuration parameters

### File Storage Configuration

Tool supports multiple storage providers. Currently following storage providers are supported:

- Local File System
- AWS S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Blob Storage

See below for configuring the storage providers.

#### Local File System

This is default storage provider. Value of SP_TASK_SYNC_STORAGE_PROVIDER must be set to `local` or leaved as empty for this storage provider to work.
There is no additional parameters / configuration options required to be specified.

Files will be stored under directory specified in SP_TASK_SYNC_SAVE_TO environment variable.

#### AWS S3

This is storage provider that allows to store files in AWS S3 Bucket. To use this provider value of SP_TASK_SYNC_STORAGE_PROVIDER must be set to `s3`.

Following additional parameters must be set (all required):

| Variable                         | Example value | Description                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SP_TASK_SYNC_S3_BUCKET           | my_bucket   | Name of the S3 bucket where the files will be stored.                                                    |
| SP_TASK_SYNC_S3_REGION           | eu-central-1 | Region of the S3 bucket.                                                                                                    |

Following methods can be used to provide credentials:
- Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- Shared credentials file at `~/.aws/credentials`
- Credentials provided by ECS orchestrator
- Credentials loaded from AWS IAM using the credentials provider of the Amazon EC2 instance (if configured in the instance metadata)

For more information see [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html)

#### Google Cloud Storage

This is storage provider that allows to store files in Google Cloud Storage. To use this provider value of SP_TASK_SYNC_STORAGE_PROVIDER must be set to `gcs`.

Following additional parameters must be set (all are required):

| Variable                 | Example value | Description                                                              |
|--------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SP_TASK_SYNC_GCS_BUCKET  | my_bucket   | Name of the GCS bucket where the files will be stored.  |
| SP_TASK_SYNC_GCS_PROJECT | my_project  | User project identification where the bucket is created.                 |

Following methods can be used to provide credentials:
- Environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` that stores path to the JSON file with the credentials of service account
- Google's default application credentials
- Credentials provided by GCP orchestrator.

For more information see [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)

#### Azure Blob Storage

This is storage provider that allows to store files in Azure Blob Storage. To use this provider value of SP_TASK_SYNC_STORAGE_PROVIDER must be set to `azure`.

Following additional parameters must be set (all are required):

| Variable                       | Example value | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SP_TASK_SYNC_AZURE_DSN         | my_bucket     | Azure DSN Connection string, containing the credentials to the BLOB storage |
| SP_TASK_SYNC_AZURE_CLIENT_NAME | my_client     | Name of teh Azure Blob Storage client                                       |

### Supported data types

Tool allows to configure which data to support while synchronizing. Following data types are supported:

- CallMetadata - Metadata of the calls. Data are downloaded as file with `meta.json` suffix. 
- Recordings - Call recordings. There may be 0 or more recordings per task. Data are downloaded as file with `.ogg` suffix.
- Transcriptions - Transcriptions of the calls. Each recording may or may not have a transcription. Data are downloaded as file with `trans.json` suffix.
- ChatMetadata - Metadata of the chat messages. Data are downloaded as file with `meta.json` suffix.
- ChatHistory - Chat history. Individual chat messages received or sent in each chat conversation.  Data are downloaded as file with `history.json` suffix.
- SMSMetadata - Metadata of the SMS messages. Data are downloaded as file with `meta.json` suffix.
- EmailMetadata - Metadata of the emails. Data are downloaded as file with `meta.json` suffix.
- CommonMetadata - Metadata of the tasks. Data are downloaded as file with `meta.json` suffix.
- WorkflowMetadata - Metadata of the workflows. Data are downloaded as file with `meta.json` suffix.


### File Name Template 

To facilitate different needs to organize and structure data at the storage provider side, there is a template that allows to provide a custom format of the directories and filenames where the data will be stored. 

The template is using the following placeholders:

| Placeholder | Example | Description |
|-------------|---|---|
| due_date    | 2021-01-01 | Due date of the task. This is the date at which the task was scheduled to be completed. Additionally, formating options can be passed after due_date to extract the date or just a part of the date. |
| task_id     | b808d74e-84b2-11ef-b864-0242ac120002 | ID of the task |
| call_from   | 420123456789 | Caller number in the E164 international format |
| call_to     | 420987654321 | Called number in the E164 international format|

To format the date (due_date), you can use date formatting options from the Java Date Format described here : [Java Date Format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). 

### Example template 

```
{{due_date|yyyy}}/{{due_date|MM}}/{{due_date|dd}}/{{due_date|yyyyMMddHHmmss}}-{{task_id}}
```

This will result in the following file name 

`2004/12/01/20041201120000-b808d74e-84b2-11ef-b864-0242ac120002`

Note that based on the type of the file, the following suffixes are added : 

| suffix       | Description|
|--------------|---|
| .ogg         | Call recording in ogg format. |
|  .trans.json | Transcription of the call in JSON format.|

If, for example, the template results in the file name above and both the recording and the transcription are downloaded, the following files will be created: 

`2004/12/01/20041201120000-b808d74e-84b2-11ef-b864-0242ac120002.ogg`
`2004/12/01/20041201120000-b808d74e-84b2-11ef-b864-0242ac120002.trans.json`

### Filtering only specific tasks to be included with synchronization

In certain situations you want to download only certain data to your storage. This can be achieved by specific whihc skills or hashtags task should, must or must not have.

For example if you want to download only tasks that have skill SK1 and SK2, you can set the following environment variable:

``` 
SP_TASK_SYNC_SKILLS_MUST=SK1,SK2
```

For HashTags, HashTag must be specified in the format `hash_tag_id:value`. 
For example if you want to download only tasks that have hashtag 1d4de98c-c130-11ef-9cd2-0242ac120002 with value `value2`, you can set the following environment variable:

```
SP_TASK_SYNC_HASHTAGS_MUST=1d4de98c-c130-11ef-9cd2-0242ac120002:value2
```

Note that for both skills and hashtags filter multiple values are supported and may be separated by comma.

## Usage

As the tool is provided as a docker image, it can be easily used by any orchestrator, which supports docker images, such as Docker Compose or Kubernetes. 

Docker image is available from the public docker hub repository - `spinoco/connector:latest`.
 

### Docker Compose 

Docker Compose is natively supported and there is even a sample `docker-compose-example.yml` file provided in the repository. 


```shell
docker-compose up -d docker-compose-example.yml
```

### Running it from the command line 

Before you can run the tool, you need to build it.

```shell
# this installs all the needed npm packages 
npm install

# this creates the distribution package in the dist directory 
npm run dist
```

To run the tool from the command line, you can use the following command

```shell
node dist/bundle.js
```
